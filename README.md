# This is a Star Trek themed memory card game that I developed with HTML, CSS and Javascript

# How to play the Game

# The game has 12 - 24 star trek themed trading cards randomized on a game board. 

# There are 3 different levels of difficulty. 
# the easy level contains 6 pairs of cards
# The medium level has 8 pairs of cards
# The hard level has 12 pairs of cards.  


# The end user clicks on each trading card to reveal the star trek character underneath.  
# Then the user can click on a second trading card to reveal another star trek character. 
# The objective is to find the matching card with the same character. When the trading card 
# characters match, the pair of cards remain revealed.  If the card characters don't match, 
# both cards flip over to hide the characters gain.
# The game ends once all cards have been correctly matched.
